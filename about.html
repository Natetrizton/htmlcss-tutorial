  <p>
    Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) is a technique in which free gaseous atoms absorb electromagnetic 
    radiation at a specific wavelength to produce a measurable signal. The absorption signal is proportional 
    to the concentration of those free absorbing atoms in the optical path. Therefore, for AAS measurements 
    the analyte must be first converted into gaseous atoms, usually by application of heat to a cell called 
    atomizer. The type of atomizer defines the two main AAS-based analytical techniques: flame AAS (FAAS) that
    provides analytical signals in a continuous fashion and electro thermal AAS (ETAAS) delivering analytical 
    signals in a discontinuous mode (2â€“4 min per sample). In both cases, liquid (or dissolved) samples are 
    easily introduced into the analyzer, as an aerosol in the case of FAAS or as well-defined low micro liter
